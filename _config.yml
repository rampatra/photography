 bio: "I am an underwater photographer, diver, and lifelong explorer of the hidden world beneath the waves. I’m endlessly fascinated by the small and often overlooked creatures that bring coral reefs to life — from flamboyant nudibranchs and pygmy seahorses to curious frogfish and ribbon eels. My photography blends art and technology, capturing these fragile moments in vivid detail while keeping the process true to nature. When I’m not diving or fine-tuning images, I’m usually tinkering with creative tech — from AI-driven photo tools to smart, cloud-based workflows. This site is my way of sharing those passions — a mix of ocean wonder, creative experimentation, and genuine curiosity about how beauty and technology can meet underwater."
